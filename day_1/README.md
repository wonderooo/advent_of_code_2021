1. As the submarine drops below the surface of the ocean, it automatically performs a sonar sweep of the nearby sea floor. On a small screen, the sonar sweep report (your puzzle input) appears: each line is a measurement of the sea floor depth as the sweep looks further and further away from the submarine.

2. Considering every single measurement isn't as useful as you expected: there's just too much noise in the data. Instead, consider sums of a three-measurement sliding window.
